# Freelancing Housewife

## Project Overview

"Freelancing Housewife" is a web application built as part of my internship program. It provides a platform for housewives and individuals with domestic skills to offer their freelancing services, connect with potential clients, and earn income from the comfort of their homes. The project is developed using the Django framework, a powerful Python web framework.
